# Worst UI Contest

[*Deutsche Version*](./README.de.md)

Welcome to the Worst UI Contest!

This is about learning about bad UIs and dark patterns through building them!

## Aim of the game

- Have fun.
- Learn about UI/UX.
- And for the competitive among you: Win!

There will be prizes for the best/worst/ugliest submission and the best analysis.

There will be a winner by public voting and a winner for the best analysis of why the submitted UI is so bad.

## Participation

Teams of up to 4 people are possible, but not mandatory.
You can also participate as a non-techie:
Either form a team and find techies, or create mockups for your terrible UI using software such as PowerPoint or Canva.

## Analysis of the implementation

With every submission you **must** give an analysis:
**What's bad about my UI?**

The analysis must be at least one sentence long and is limited to a maximum of 5 fundamental problems with the UI.

Tried and tested criteria for UI/UX reviews can be found [here (German only)](./RESOURCES.de.md).

## Submission

Post a Slack post in [#ec25-worst-ui](https://qaware.slack.com/archives/C08Q8602MQC), including:

- Participant list, *optionally a team name*
- Video of your creation (or screenshot, in case it isn't interactive or animated)
- *optionally a repo/demo link as well*
- Analysis of the violated design principles and standards (at least one sentence).

Submission deadline: before the working day on Monday 19 May.

*Important*: Please only submit designs that we can use in the upcoming QAtalk “Design principles and standards” (no UIs from customer projects).

## Voting

Anyone can participate in the public voting.
Just add the emoji <img style="height: 1lh; vertical-align: bottom" src="./xdddd.gif"> `:xdddd:` to any post you like!

Deadline: before the working day on Tuesday, 20 May 2025

## Award ceremony

The announcement of the winners will take place during a QAtalk in the coming weeks.

## Theme

If you need inspiration, you are welcome to come up with UIs on the topic of “Engineering Camp”.

## Template

There are template applications available for you in this repo:

- [Vue](./vue/)
- [React](./react/)
- [Angular](./angular/)
- [HTML](./html/)

You are also welcome to start with an existing application.
However, this application must be publicly accessible:
Submissions that use **code from customer projects** are **forbidden**.

| Evaluation category       | Explanation                                                                                                            | Example                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scope of issues addressed | How many basic UI issues were addressed?                                                                               | _The accessibility of the application is in need of improvement._ |
| Justification             | Was it explained why this design violates principles?                                                                  | _You can hardly read the white text on a light grey background._  |
| Reference to standards    | Does the analysis refer to specific guidelines / heuristics?                                                           | _This contradicts WCAG 2.2 in the point ‘Sufficient contrast’._   |
| Bonus                     | Scope for the jury if something stands out positively in the analysis that is _not_ explicitly an evaluation criterion |                                                                   |
